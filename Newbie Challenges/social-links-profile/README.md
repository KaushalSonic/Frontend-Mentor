I learnt to use figure and figcaption semantic tags for placing profile image and image caption.

```html
<figure>
  <div class="profile-pic">
    <img src="./images/kaushal.webp" alt="Kaushal" />
  </div>
  <figcaption>
    <h1>Kaushal Kishore</h1>
    <p>Bokaro Steel City, India</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Continued development

I am looking forward for more challenges and build them while learning.
