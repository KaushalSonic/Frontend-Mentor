### What I learned

I learnt to implement background color as well as background image in the same div on the hero section of Huddle Landing Page

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="wrapper"></div>
```

```css
.wrapper {
  background-image: url("./images/bg-desktop.svg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: contain;
  background-color: var(--Violet);
  min-height: 100vh;
  padding: 1.4rem 5rem;
}
```
